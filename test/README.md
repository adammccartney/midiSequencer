# Unit tests

These tests utilize [GoogleTest](https://github.com/googletest) and assume that
they are installed on the local machine where the program is being run. There
are no other dependencies apart from that. The tests are written with a view to
testing the logic classes of the program, so they are localized and do not test
any of the openFrameworks classes.

To run unit tests, simply run:
```
make test
```
